My name is Cameron Gazey, and I have been working professionally in the video game industry since 2014. I currently work at [_Snowed In Studios, Inc._](https://snowedin.ca) as a Senior Software Developer where I have led or assisted programming teams on titles such as _Fallout Shelter_, _Forza Horizon 5_, _As Dusk Falls_, _The Elder Scrolls: Castles_, and others. I am also a technical interviewer and a mentor for game programming students. In my free time, I like to make small games and prototypes in [_PICO-8_](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

This website exists not only because I like to teach, but because I wish to provide depth and nuance to game programming topics that you seldom find elsewhere on the internet.

This site is open-source. All changes made can be tracked [here](https://github.com/skaarjslayer/gazey.github.io).
