Hello there,

My name is Cameron, and I am a Canadian game developer who has been working in the games industry since 2014. My passion for making games started in childhood, when I first played _Unreal_ back in 1998. I was awed by its (at the time) cutting-edge graphics, mesmerizing atmosphere, and unforgettable soundtrack. I played it obsessively and wanted to know everything about the game's story—sparse though it was—and more.

Sometimes a great game intentionally leaves just enough to the imagination, and an even greater one gives you the tools to bring that imagination to life. _Unreal_ shipped with the engine and tools that the developers used to make the game (at the time called _UnrealEd_), which led to a thriving modding scene where players created new maps, stories, and experiences. I eagerly downloaded and played as many as I could.

I also tinkered with UnrealEd myself. Of course, I was only seven years old at the time and never quite figured out how to make anything worth sharing, but that didn’t stop me from playing around with it. I had my own stories I wanted to tell and was hooked by the realization that creating experiences like this could one day be my job.

From shipping Unity mobile games in C#, to doing AAA PC/console titles in C++, to writing my own small games in Lua with PICO-8. I've seen and done many things. But the learning never stops. As the saying goes: a true master is an eternal student. And so I, as are you, are here to learn. 

I currently work at Snowed In Studios, Inc. as a Senior Software Developer and live a peaceful life in Ottawa, Canada. Aside from video games, I like camping, books, and heavy metal.
